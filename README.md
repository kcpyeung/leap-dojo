# leap

A skeletal project to get started with the leap year dojo on exercism.io quickly.

See http://exercism.io/exercises/clojure/leap/readme for original dojo problem.

## Installation

You should have Leiningen and Clojure already installed. Once done, run `lein test` to see your first failing test.
